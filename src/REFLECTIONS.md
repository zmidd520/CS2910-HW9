In it's current state, this app doesn't log anything during runtime, so it is vulnerable in regards to security logging. It's also confined to whatever version of ws is currently installed (unless I were to update it, but for the sake of the argument, it's forever stuck on this version), which puts it at risk of any vulnerabilities that may come with the current version. I wasn't able to make any injection-related stuff happen, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone more experienced with injection was able to make something happen on that front.

This exercise taught me more about how Javascript can be used to interact with the DOM. I wanted to experiment with "dynamic css" for lack of a better term, and see if I could allow the user some agency over what color their messages appeared in. I took the general idea of the functions that the example code already had and tweaked it in order to make it fit my needs. After a little bit of extra research, I was able to make a dropdown menu on the DOM that changes the color of the messages being sent. This assignment was also a good opportunity to test my progress with learning Javascript, and I was pleasantly surprised with how few mistakes I ended up making when writing my own code.
